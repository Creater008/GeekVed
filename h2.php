<td><p><strong>Soldering</strong> is a process in which two or more metal items are joined together by  melting and flowing a filler metalsolder) into  the joint, the filler metal having a lower melting point than the  workpiece. Soldering differs from weldingin that  soldering does not involve melting the work pieces. In brazing, the  filler metal melts at a higher temperature, but the workpiece metal does not  melt. Formerly nearly all solders contained lead, but environmental concerns  have increasingly dictated use of lead-free alloys for electronics and plumbing  purposes.</p>

<td id="g3"><p>Soldering  filler materials are available in many different alloys</a> for  differing applications. In electronics assembly, the eutectic</a> alloy of  63% tin and 37% lead (or 60/40, which is almost identical in melting point) has  been the alloy of choice. Other alloys are used for plumbing, mechanical  assembly, and other applications. Some examples of soft-solder are tin-lead for  general purposes, tin-zinc for joining aluminium</a>,  lead-silver for strength at higher than room temperature, cadmium-silver for  strength at high temperatures, zinc-aluminium for aluminium and corrosion  resistance, and tin-silver and tin-bismuth for electronics.<br>
  A  eutectic formulation has advantages when applied to soldering: theliquidus</a> and solidus</a> temperatures are the same, so there is no plastic phase, and it has the lowest  possible melting point. Having the lowest possible melting point minimizes heat  stress on electronic components during soldering. And, having no plastic phase  allows for quicker wetting as the solder heats up, and quicker setup as the  solder cools. A non-eutectic formulation must remain still as the temperature  drops through the liquidus and solidus temperatures. Any movement during the  plastic phase may result in cracks, resulting in a unreliable joint.<br>
  Common  solder formulations based on tin and lead are listed below. The fraction  represent percentage of tin first, then lead, totaling 100%:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>63/37:       melts at 183 &deg;C (361&nbsp;&deg;F) (eutectic: the only mixture that melts at a <em>point</em>,       instead of over a range)</li>
    <li>60/40:       melts between 183&ndash;190 &deg;C (361&ndash;374&nbsp;&deg;F)</li>
    <li>50/50:       melts between 185&ndash;215 &deg;C (365&ndash;419&nbsp;&deg;F)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For  environmental reasons (and the introduction of regulations such as the European  RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances  Directive)) lead-free solders are becoming more widely used. They are also  suggested anywhere young children may come into contact with (since young  children are likely to place things into their mouths), or for outdoor use  where rain and other precipitation may wash the lead into the groundwater.  Unfortunately, most lead-free solders are not eutectic formulations, melting at  around 250 &deg;C (482&nbsp;&deg;F), making it more difficult to create reliable joints  with them.<br>
    Other  common solders include low-temperature formulations (often containing bismuth</a>), which  are often used to join previously-soldered assemblies without un-soldering  earlier connections, and high-temperature formulations (usually containing silver</a>) which  are used for high-temperature operation or for first assembly of items which  must not become unsoldered during subsequent operations. Alloying silver with  other metals changes the melting point, adhesion and wetting characteristics,  and tensile strength. Of all the brazing alloys, brazing has the greatest  strength, with silver solders not being substantially stronger than soft solder  and having the broadest applications.Specialty alloys are available with properties such as higher strength, better  electrical conductivity and higher corrosion resistance.</p>

<tr>
<td id="g4"><p>The  purpose of flux is to  facilitate the soldering process. The obstacle to a successful solder joint is  an impurity at the site of the union, e.g. dirt, oils or oxidation</a>. The  impurities can be removed by mechanical cleaning or by chemical means, but the  elevated temperatures required to melt the filler metal (the solder) encourages  the work piece (and the solder) to re-oxidize. This effect is accelerated as  the soldering temperatures increase and can completely prevent the solder from  joining to the workpiece. One of the earliest forms of flux wascharcoal</a>, which  acts as a reducing agent</a> and  helps prevent oxidation during the soldering process. Some fluxes go beyond the  simple prevention of oxidation and also provide some form of chemical cleaning  (corrosion).<br>
  For many  years, the most common type of flux used in electronics (soft soldering) was rosin</a>-based,  using the rosin from selected pine trees</a>. It was  ideal in that it was non-corrosive and non-conductive at normal temperatures  but became mildly reactive (corrosive) at the elevated soldering temperatures.  Plumbing and automotive applications, among others, typically use an acid-based  (muriatic  acid</a>) flux which provides cleaning of the joint. These fluxes cannot be used  in electronics because they are conductive and because they will eventually  dissolve the small diameter wires. Many fluxes also act as a wetting  agent</a> in the soldering process,reducing the surface tension</a> of the  molten solder and causing it to flow and wet the workpieces more easily.<br>
  Fluxes  for soft solder are currently available in three basic formulations:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>Water-soluble       fluxes (no VOCs</a> required for removal) are higher activity fluxes designed to be removed with water after soldering.</li>
    <li>No-clean       fluxes which are mild enough to not &quot;require&quot; removal due to the       non-conductive and non-corrosive residue. Performance of the flux needs to be carefully evaluated; a very mild       'no-clean' flux might be perfectly acceptable for production equipment,       but not give adequate performance for a poorly controlled hand-soldering       operation. They are so-called &quot;no-clean&quot; because the residue       left after the solder operation is non-conductive and won't cause       electrical shorts; nevertheless these fluxes leave a white-color residue       like dilute bird-droppings. which is plainly visible. Since the presence       of discernible flux residue on circuit boards is a <em>defect</em> for all       three classes of electronic circuit boards (ranging from cheap consumer       electronics to high-reliability, mission critical applications), these       sorts of fluxes must still be cleaned as with all hand solder work,       typically brushing with 99% isopropyl alcohol as the solvent and lint-free       non-synthetic (eg cotton) wipes.</li>
    <li>Traditional rosin</a> fluxes are available in non-activated (R),       mildly activated (RMA) and activated (RA) formulations. RA and RMA fluxes       contain rosin combined with an activating agent, typically an acid, which       increases the wettability of metals to which it is applied by removing       existing oxides. The residue resulting from the use of RA flux is corrosive</a> and must be cleaned off the piece being       soldered. RMA flux is formulated to result in a residue which is not       significantly corrosive, with cleaning being preferred but optional.</li>

<td id="g5"><p>There are  three forms of soldering, each requiring progressively higher temperatures and  producing an increasingly stronger joint strength:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>Soft       soldering, which originally used a tin-lead alloy</a> as       the filler metal,</li>
    <li>silver       soldering, which uses an alloy containing silver</a>,</li>
    <li>brazing</a> which uses a brass alloy for the filler.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The alloy  of the filler metal for each type of soldering can be adjusted to modify the  melting temperature of the filler. Soldering differs from gluing significantly  in that the filler metals alloy with the workpiece at the junction to form a  gas- and liquid-tight bond.<br>
    Soft  soldering is characterized by having a melting point of the filler metal below  approximately 400 &deg;C (752&nbsp;&deg;F), whereas  silver soldering and brazing use higher temperatures, typically requiring a  flame or carbon arc torch to achieve the melting of the filler. Soft solder  filler metals are typically alloys (often containing lead</a>) that have liquidus</a> temperatures below 350&deg;C.<br>
    In this  soldering process, heat is applied to the parts to be joined, causing the  solder to melt and to bond to the workpieces in an alloying process called wetting</a>. In  stranded wire, the solder is drawn up into the wire by capillary action</a> in a  process called 'wicking'. Capillary action also takes place when the workpieces  are very close together or touching. The joint strength is dependent on the  filler metal used. Soldering produces electrically-conductive, water- and  gas-tight joints.<br>
    Each type  of solder offers advantages and disadvantages. Soft solder is so called because  of the soft lead that is its primary ingredient.Soft soldering uses the lowest  temperatures but does not make a strong join and is unsuitable for mechanical  load-bearing applications. It is also unsuitable for high-temperature  applications as it softens and melts. Silver soldering, as used by jewelers,  machinists and in some plumbing applications, requires the use of a torch or  other high-temperature source, and is much stronger than soft soldering.  Brazing provides the strongest joint but also requires the hottest temperatures  to melt the filler metal, requiring a torch or other high temperature source  and darkened goggles to protect the eyes from the bright light produced by the  white-hot work. It is often used to repair cast-iron objects, wrought-iron  furniture, etc.<br>
    Soldering  operations can be performed with hand tools, one joint at a time, or <em>en  masse</em> on a production line. Hand soldering is typically performed with a soldering  iron</a>, soldering gun, or a  torch, or occasionally a hot-air pencil.  Sheetmetal work was traditionally done with &quot;soldering coppers&quot;  directly heated by a flame, with sufficient stored heat in the mass of the soldering  copper to complete a joint; torches or electrically-heated soldering irons are  more convenient. All soldered joints require the same elements of cleaning of  the metal parts to be joined, fitting up the joint, heating the parts, applying  flux, applying the filler, removing heat and holding the assembly still until  the filler metal has completely solidified. Depending on the nature of flux  material used, cleaning of the joints may be required after they have cooled.<br>
    Each  alloy has characteristics that work best for certain applications, notably  strength and conductivity, and each type of solder and alloy has different  melting temperatures. The term silver solder likewise denotes the type of  solder that is used. Some soft solders are &quot;silver bearing&quot; alloys  used to solder silver-plated items. Lead based solders should not be used on  precious metals because the lead dissolves the metal and disfigures it.</p>

<td id="g6"><p>The  distinction between soldering and brazing is based on the melting temperature  of the filler alloy. A temperature of 450 &deg;C is usually used as a practical  delineating point between soldering and brazing . Soft soldering can be done  with a heated iron whereas the other methods require a higher temperature torch  or furnace to melt the filler metal.<br>
  Different  equipment is usually required since a soldering iron cannot  achieve high enough temperatures for hard soldering or brazing. Brazing filler  metal is stronger than silver solder, which is stronger than lead-based soft  solder. Brazing solders are formulated primarily for strength, silver solder is  used by jewelers to protect the precious metal and by machinists and  refrigeration technicians for its strength but lower melting temperature than  brazing, and the primary benefit of soft solder is the low temperature used (to  prevent heat damage to electronic components and insulation).<br>
  Since the  joint is produced using a metal with a lower melting temperature than the  workpiece, the joint will weaken as the ambient temperature approaches the  melting point of the filler metal. For that reason, the higher temperature  processes produce joints which are effective at higher temperatures. Brazed  connections can be as strong or nearly as strong as the parts they connect, even at  elevated temperatures. </p>

<td id="g7"><p>&quot;Hard  soldering&quot; or &quot;silver soldering&quot; is used to join precious and  semi-precious metals such as gold, silver, brass, and copper. The solder is  usually referred to as easy, medium, or hard. This refers to its melting  temperature, not the strength of the joint. Extra-easy solder contains 56%  silver and has a melting point of 1,145 &deg;F (618&nbsp;&deg;C). Extra-hard solder has  80% silver and melts at 1,370 &deg;F (740&nbsp;&deg;C). If multiple joints are needed,  then the jeweler will start with hard or extra-hard solder and switch to lower  temperature solders for later joints.<br>
  Silver  solder is absorbed by the surrounding metal, resulting in a joint that is  actually stronger than the metal being joined. The metal being joined must be  perfectly flush, as silver solder cannot normally be used as a filler and any  gaps will remain.<br>
  Another  difference between brazing and soldering is how the solder is applied. In  brazing, one generally uses rods that are touched to the joint while being  heated. With silver soldering, small pieces of solder wire are placed onto the  metal prior to heating. A flux, often made of borax and water, is used to keep  the metal and solder clean and to prevent the solder from moving before it  melts.<br>
  When  silver solder melts, it tends to flow towards the area of greatest heat.  Jewelers can somewhat control the direction the solder moves by leading it with  a torch; it will even run straight up along a seam.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td id="g8"><p>Induction  soldering uses induction heating by  high-frequency AC current in a surrounding copper coil. This induces currents  in the part being soldered, with generates heat because of the higher  resistance of a joint versus its surrounding metal (resistive heating). These  copper coils can be shaped to fit the joint more precisely. A filler metal  (solder) is placed between the facing surfaces, and this solder melts at a  fairly low temperature. Fluxes are commonly used in induction soldering. This  technique is particularly suited to continuously soldering, in which case these  coils wrap around a cylinder or a pipe that needs to be soldered.<br>
    Some  metals are easier to solder than others. Copper, silver, and gold are easy.  Iron, mild  steel and nickel are next  in difficulty. Because of their thin, strong oxide films, stainless  steel and aluminium are even more difficult to solder. Titanium, magnesium, cast irons, some  high-carbon steels, ceramics, and graphite can be  soldered but it involves a process similar to joining carbides: they are first  plated with a suitable metallic element that induces interfacial bonding.</p>

<td id="g9"><p>Currently,  mass-production printed circuit boards (PCBs) are mostly wave  soldered or reflow soldered, though  hand soldering of production electronics is also still standard practice.<br>
  In wave  soldering, parts are temporarily kept in place with small dabs of adhesive,  then the assembly is passed over flowing solder in a bulk container. This  solder is shaken into waves so the whole PCB is not submerged in solder, but  rather touched by these waves. The end result is that solder stays on pins and  pads, but not on the PCB itself.<br>
  Reflow  soldering is a process in which a solder paste (a  mixture of prealloyed solder powder and a flux-vehicle that has a peanut  butter-like consistency) is used  to stick the components to their attachment pads, after which the assembly is  heated by an infrared lamp; a hot air pencil; or, more commonly, by passing it  through a carefully controlled oven.<br>
  Since  different components can be best assembled by different techniques, it is  common to use two or more processes for a given PCB. For example, surface mounted parts may be reflow soldered  first, with a wave soldering process for the through-hole mounted  components coming next, and bulkier parts hand-soldered last.<br>
  For hand  soldering, the heat source tool should be selected to provide adequate heat for  the size of joint to be completed. A 100 watt soldering iron may provide too  much heat for printed circuit boards, while a 25 watt iron will not provide  enough heat for large electrical connectors, joining copper roof flashing, or large  stained-glass lead came. Using a tool with too high a temperature can damage  sensitive components, but protracted heating by a tool that is too cool or  under powered can also cause extensive heat damage.<br>
  Hand-soldering  techniques require a great deal of skill to use on what is known as fine-pitch  soldering of chip packages. In particular ball grid array (BGA) devices  are notoriously difficult, if not impossible, to rework by hand.<br>
  For  attachment of electronic components to a PCB, proper selection and use of flux  helps prevent oxidation during soldering, which is essential for good wetting and  heat transfer. The soldering iron tip must be clean and pre-tinned with solder  to ensure rapid heat transfer. Components which dissipate large amounts of heat  during operation are sometimes elevated above the PCB to avoid PCB overheating.  After inserting a through-hole mounted component, the excess lead is cut off,  leaving a length of about the radius of the pad. Plastic or metal mounting  clips or holders may be used with large devices to aid heat dissipation and  reduce joint stresses.<br>
  A heat  sink may be used on the leads of heat sensitive components to reduce heat  transfer to the component. This is especially applicable to germanium parts.  (Note the heat sink will mean the use of more heat to complete the joint.) If  all metal surfaces are not properly fluxed and brought above the melting  temperature of the solder in use, the result will be an unreliable &quot;cold  solder joint&quot;.<br>
  To  simplify soldering, beginners are usually advised to apply the soldering iron  and the solder separately to the joint, rather than the solder being applied  direct to the iron. When sufficient solder is applied, the solder wire is  removed. When the surfaces are adequately heated, the solder will flow around  the joint. The iron is then removed from the joint.<br>
  Since  non-eutectic solder alloys have a small plastic range, the joint must not be  moved until the solder has cooled down through both the liquidus and solidus  temperatures. When visually inspected, a good solder joint will appear smooth  and shiny, with the outline of the soldered wire clearly visible. A matte gray  surface is a good indicator of a joint that was moved during soldering.<br>
  Other  solder defects can be detected visually as well. Too little solder will result  in a dry and unreliable joint; too much solder (the familiar 'solder blob' to  beginners) is not necessarily unsound, but tends to mean poor wetting. With  some fluxes, flux residue remaining on the joint may need to be removed, using  water, alcohol or other solvents compatible with the parts in question.<br>
  Excess  solder and unconsumed flux and residue is sometimes wiped from the soldering  iron tip between joints. The tip of the iron is kept wetted with solder  (&quot;tinned&quot;) when hot to minimize oxidation and corrosion of the tip  itself.<br>
  Environmental  legislation in many countries, and the whole of the European  Community area (see ROHS), has led to a change in  formulation of both solders and fluxes. Water soluble non-rosin based fluxes  have been increasingly used since the 1980s so that soldered boards can be  cleaned with water or water based cleaners. This eliminates hazardous solvents  from the production environment, and from factory effluents.</p>

    Solder<br>
  Copper  pipe, or 'tube', is commonly joined by soldering. When applied in a plumbing  trade context, soldering is more often referred to as <em>sweating</em> and a  tubing connection so made is referred to as a <em>sweated joint</em>.<br>
  Copper  tubing conducts heat away much faster than a hand-held soldering iron or gun  can provide, so a propane torch is most  commonly used to deliver the necessary power; for large tubing sizes and  fittings a MAPP-fueled, acetylene-fueled,  or propylene-fueled  torch is used with atmospheric air as the oxidizer; MAPP&dagger;/oxygen or  acetylene/oxygen are rarely used because the flame temperature is much higher  than the melting point of copper. Too much heat destroys the temper of  hard-tempered copper tubing, and can burn the flux out of a joint before the  solder is added, resulting in a faulty joint. For larger tubing sizes, a torch  fitted with various sizes of interchangeable <em>swirl tips</em> is employed to  deliver the needed power.<br>
  Most  experienced plumbers seldom use propane fuel. In the hands of a skilled  tradesman, the hotter flame of acetylene, MAPP, or propylene allows more joints  to be completed per hour.<br>
  Solder  fittings, which are short sections of smooth pipe designed to slide over the  outside of the mating tube, are usually used for copper joints. There are two  types of fittings: <em>end feed fittings</em> which contain no solder, and solder  ring fittings (often known as Yorkshire fittings), in which  there is a ring of solder in a small circular recess inside the fitting.<br>
  As with  all solder joints, all parts to be joined must be clean and oxide free.  Internal and external wire brushes are available for the common pipe and  fitting sizes; emery cloth and  wire-wool are frequently used as well, although metal wool products are  discouraged, as they can contain oil, which would contaminate the joint.<br>
  Because  of the size of the parts involved, and the high activity and contaminating  tendency of the flame, plumbing fluxes are typically much more chemically  active, and more acidic, than electronic fluxes. Because plumbing joints may be  done at any angle, even upside down, plumbing fluxes are generally formulated  as pastes which stay in place better than liquids. Flux should be applied to  all surfaces of the joint, inside and out. Flux residues should be removed  after the joint is complete or they can, eventually, erode through the copper  substrates and cause failure of the joint.<br>
  Many  plumbing solder formulations are available, with different characteristics such  as higher or lower melting temperature, depending on the specific requirements  of the job. Building codes currently almost universally require the use of  lead-free solder for potable water piping, though traditional tin-lead solder  is still available. Studies have shown that lead-soldered plumbing pipes can  result in elevated levels of lead in drinking water.<br>
  Since  copper pipe quickly conducts heat away from a joint, great care must be taken  to sense that the joint is properly heated through to obtain a good bond. After  the joint is properly cleaned, fluxed and fitted, the torch flame is applied to  the thickest part of the joint, typically the fitting with the pipe inside it,  with the solder applied at the gap between the tube and the fitting. When all  the parts are heated through, the solder will melt and flow into the joint by  capillary action. The torch may need to be moved around the joint to ensure all  areas are wetted out. However, the installer must take care to not overheat the  areas being soldered. If the tube begins to discolor it means that the tube has  been over-heated and is beginning to oxidize, stopping the flow of the solder  and causing the soldered joint not to seal properly. Before oxidation the  molten solder will follow the heat of the torch around the joint. When the  joint is properly wetted out, the solder and then the heat are removed, and  while the joint is still very hot, it is usually wiped with a dry rag. This  removes excess solder as well as flux residue before it cools down and hardens.  With a solder ring joint, the joint is heated until a ring of molten solder is  visible around the edge of the fitting and allowed to cool.<br>
  Solder  connections are usually considered the most difficult of the three methods of  connecting copper tubing, but soldering copper is a very simple process,  provided some basic conditions are provided:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>The       tubing and fittings must be cleaned to bare metal with no tarnish</li>
    <li>Any       pressure which is formed by heating of the tubing must have an outlet</li>
    <li>The       joint must be dry (which makes repairing water pipes by soldering tedious)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Copper is  only one material that is joined in this manner. Brass fittings are often used  for valves or as a connection fitting between copper and other metals. Brass  piping is soldered in this manner in the making of brass and some woodwind  (saxophone and flute) musical instruments</p></td>

<td id="g14"><p>A number  of solder materials, primarily zinc alloys, are used for soldering  aluminium metal and alloys and to some lesser extent steel and zinc. This  mechanical soldering is similar to a low temperature brazing operation, in that  the mechanical characteristics of the joint are reasonably good and it can be  used for structural repairs of those materials.<br>
  The American welding society defines  brazing as using filler metals with melting points over 450 &deg;C (842&nbsp;&deg;F) &mdash;  or, by the traditional definition in the United States, above 800 &deg;F  (427&nbsp;&deg;C). Aluminium soldering alloys generally have melting temperatures  around 730 &deg;F (388&nbsp;&deg;C). This  soldering / brazing operation can use a propane torch heat source.<br>
  These  materials are often advertised as &quot;aluminium welding&quot;, but the  process does not involve melting the base metal, and therefore is not properly  a weld.<br>
  United States Military Standard or  MIL-SPEC specification MIL-R-4208 defines one standard for these zinc-based  brazing/soldering alloys. A number  of products meet this specification or very  similar performance standards.</p></td>

<td id="g15">It is  soldering in which the heat required to flow the solder is created by passing  an electric current through the solder. When current is conducted through a  resistive material a certain level of heat is generated. By regulating the  amount of current conducted and the level of resistance encountered, the amount  of heat produced can be predetermined and controlled.<br>
  Electrical  resistance (usually described as a material's opposition to the flow of an  electric current) is used to convert electric energy into thermal energy as an  electric current (I) conducted through a material with resistance (R) releases  power (P) equal to: P = I&sup2; R, where P is the power measured in watts, I is the  current measured in amps and R is the resistance measured in ohms.</td>

<td><p>Resistance  soldering is unlike using a conduction iron, where heat is produced within an  element and then passed through a thermally conductive tip into the joint area.  A cold soldering iron requires time to reach working temperature and must be  kept hot between solder joints. Thermal transfer may be inhibited if the tip is  not kept properly wetted during use. With resistance soldering an intense heat  can be rapidly developed directly within the joint area and in a tightly  controlled manner. This allows a faster ramp up to the required solder melt  temperature and minimizes thermal travel away from the solder joint, which  helps to minimize the potential for thermal damage to materials or components  in the surrounding area. Heat is only produced while each joint is being made,  making resistance soldering more energy efficient. Resistance soldering  equipment, unlike conduction irons, can be used for difficult soldering and  brazing applications where significantly higher temperatures may be required.  This makes resistance comparable to flame soldering in some situations. When  the required temperature can be achieved by either flame or resistance methods  the resistance heat is more localized because of direct contact, whereas the  flame will spread thus heating a potentially larger area.</p></td>

<td id="g16"><p>Historically, stained  glass soldering tips were copper, heated by being placed in a charcoal-burning brazier.  Multiple tips were used; when one tip cooled down from use, it was placed back  in the brazier of charcoal and the next tip was used.<br>
  More  recently, electrically heated soldering irons are used. These are heated by a  coil or ceramic heating element inside the tip of the iron. Different power  ratings are available, and temperature can be controlled electronically. These  characteristics allow longer beads to be run without interrupting the work to  change tips. Soldering irons designed for electronic use are often effective  though they are sometimes underpowered for the heavy copper and lead came used  in stained glass work. Oleic acid is the classic flux material that has been  used to improve solderability.<br>
  Tiffany  type stainglass steel is made by gluing copper foil around the edges of the  pieces of glass and then soldering them together. This method makes it possible  to create three dimensional stained glass pieces.</p>

<td id="g18"><p>Used  solder contains some of the dissolved base metals and is unsuitable for reuse  in making new joints. Once the solder's capacity for the base metal has been  achieved it will no longer properly bond with the base metal, usually resulting  in a brittle cold solder joint with a crystalline appearance.<br>
  It is  good practice to remove solder from a joint prior to resoldering&mdash;desoldering  braids or vacuum desoldering equipment (solder suckers) can be  used. Desoldering wicks contain plenty of flux that will lift the contamination  from the copper trace and any device leads that are present. This will leave a  bright, shiny, clean junction to be resoldered. <br>
  The lower  melting point of solder means it can be melted away from the base metal, leaving  it mostly intact, though the outer layer will be &quot;tinned&quot; with  solder. Flux will remain which can easily be removed by abrasive or chemical  processes. This tinned layer will allow solder to flow into a new joint,  resulting in a new joint, as well as making the new solder flow very quickly  and easily.</p></td>

<td id="g19"><p>More  recently environmental legislation has specifically targeted the wide use of  lead in the electronics industry. The RoHS directives in Europe required many  new electronic circuit boards to be lead free by 1 July 2006, mostly in the  consumer goods industry, but in some others as well. In Japan lead was phased  out prior to legislation by manufacturers due to the additional expense in  recycling products containing lead.<br>
  It is a  common misconception that lead free soldering requires higher soldering  temperatures than lead/tin solder; the wetting temperature in lead/tin solder  is higher than the melting point and is the controlling factor - Wave soldering  can proceed at the same temperature as previous lead/tin soldering. Nevertheless many new technical challenges have arisen with this endeavor; to  reduce the melting point of tin based solder alloys various new alloys have had  to be researched, with additives of copper, silver, bismuth as typical minor  additives to reduce melting point and control other properties, additionally  tin is a more corrosive metal, and can eventually lead to the failure of solder  baths etc.<br>
  Lead-free  construction has also extended to components, pins, and connectors. Most of  these pins used copper frames, and either lead, tin, gold or other finishes.  Tin finishes are the most popular of lead-free finishes. Nevertheless, this  brings up the issue of how to deal with tin  whiskers. The current movement brings the electronics industry back to the  problems solved in the 1960s by adding lead. JEDEC has created a classification  system to help lead-free electronic manufacturers decide what provisions to  take against whiskers, depending upon their application.</p></td>

<td id="g20"><p>In the  joining of copper tube, failure to properly heat and fill a joint may lead to a  'void' being formed. This is usually a result of improper placement of the  flame. If the heat of the flame is not directed at the back of the fitting cup,  and the solder wire applied 180 degrees opposite the flame, then solder will  quickly fill the opening of the fitting, trapping some flux inside the joint.  This bubble of trapped flux is the void; an area inside a soldered joint where  solder is unable to completely fill the fittings' cup, because flux has become  sealed inside the joint, preventing solder from occupying that space.</p>
  <p><strong id="g21">Electronics</strong>:<br>
    Various  problems may arise in the soldering process which lead to joints which are non functional  either immediately or after a period of use.<br>
    The most  common defect when hand-soldering results from the parts being joined not  exceeding the solder's liquidus temperature, resulting in a &quot;cold  solder&quot; joint. This is usually the result of the soldering iron being used  to heat the solder directly, rather than the parts themselves. Properly done,  the iron heats the parts to be connected, which in turn melt the solder,  guaranteeing adequate heat in the joined parts for thorough wetting. In electronic  hand soldering the flux is embedded in the solder. Therefore heating the solder  first may cause the flux to evaporate before it cleans the surfaces being  soldered. A cold-soldered joint may not conduct at all, or may conduct only  intermittently. Cold-soldered joints also happen in mass production, and are a  common cause of equipment which passes testing, but malfunctions after  sometimes years of operation. A &quot;dry joint&quot; occurs when the cooling  solder is moved, and often occurs because the joint moves when the soldering  iron is removed from the joint.<br>
    An  improperly selected or applied flux can cause joint failure. If not properly  cleaned, a flux may corrode the joint and cause eventual joint failure. Without  flux the joint may not be clean, or may be oxidized, resulting in an unsound  joint.<br>
    In  electronics non-corrosive fluxes are often used. Therefore cleaning flux off  may merely be a matter of aesthetics or to make visual inspection of joints  easier in specialised 'mission critical' applications such as medical devices,  military and aerospace. For satellites also to reduce weight slightly but  usefully. In high humidity, even non-corrosive flux might remain slightly  active, therefore the flux may be removed to reduce corrosion over time. In  some applications, the PCB might also be coated in some form of protective  material such as a lacquer to  protect it and exposed solder joints from the environment.<br>
    Movement  of metals being soldered before the solder has cooled will cause a highly  unreliable cracked joint. In electronics' soldering terminology this is known  as a 'dry' joint. It has a characteristically dull or grainy appearance  immediately after the joint is made, rather than being smooth, bright and  shiny. This appearance is caused by crystallization of the liquid solder. A dry  joint is weak mechanically and a poor conductor electrically.<br>
    In  general a good looking soldered joint <em>is</em> a good joint. As mentioned it  should be smooth, bright and shiny. If the joint has lumps or balls of  otherwise shiny solder the metal has not 'wetted' properly. Not being bright  and shiny suggests a weak 'dry' joint. However, technicians trying to apply  this guideline when using lead-free solder formulations may experience  frustration, because these types of solders readily cool to a dull surface even  if the joint is good. The solder looks shiny while molten, and suddenly hazes  over as it solidifies even though it has not been disturbed during cooling.<br>
    In  electronics a 'concave' fillet  is ideal. This indicates good wetting and minimal use of solder (therefore  minimal <em>heating</em> of heat sensitive components). A joint may be good, but  if a large amount of unnecessary solder is used then more heating is obviously  required. Excessive heating of a PCB may result in 'delamination', the copper  track may actually lift off the board, particularly on single sided PCBs  without through hole plating.</p>
  <p><strong id="g21">Tools</strong>:<br>
    In  principle any type of soldering tool can carry out any work using solder at  temperatures it can generate. In practice different tools are more suitable for  different applications.<br>
    Hand-soldering  tools widely used for electronics work include the electric soldering iron,  which can be fitted with a variety of tips ranging from blunt to very fine, to  chisel heads for hot-cutting plastics rather than soldering. The simplest irons  do not have temperature regulation; small irons rapidly cool when used to  solder to, say, a metal chassis, while large irons have tips too cumbersome for  working on PCBs and similar fine work. Temperature-controlled irons have a  reserve of power and can maintain temperature over a wide range of work. The soldering  gun heats  faster but has a larger and heavier body. Gas-powered irons using a catalytic  tip to heat a bit, without flame, are used for portable applications. Hot-air  guns and pencils allow rework of  component packages which cannot easily be performed with electric irons and  guns.<br>
    For  non-electronic applications soldering torches use a flame rather than a  soldering tip to heat solder. Soldering torches are often powered by butane and are  available in sizes ranging from very small butane/oxygen units suitable for  very fine but high-temperature jewelry work, to full-size oxy-fuel torches  suitable for much larger work such as copper piping. Common multipurpose  propane torches, the same kind used for heat-stripping paint and thawing pipes,  can be used for soldering pipes and other fairly large objects either with or  without a soldering tip attachment; pipes are generally soldered with a torch  by directly applying the open flame.<br>
    A  soldering copper is a tool with a large copper head and a long handle which is  heated in a blacksmith's forge  fire and used to apply heat to sheet metal for  soldering. Typical soldering coppers have heads weighing between one and four  pounds. The head provides a large thermal mass to store  enough heat for soldering large areas before needing re-heating in the fire;  the larger the head, the longer the working time. Historically, soldering  coppers were standard tools used in auto bodywork, although body  solder has been mostly superseded by spot welding for  mechanical connection, and non-metallic fillers for contouring.<br>
    Toaster  ovens and hand held infrared lights have been used by hobbyists to replicate  production soldering processes on a much smaller scale.<br>
    Bristle  brushes are usually used to apply plumbing paste flux. For electronic work,  flux-core solder is generally used, but additional flux may be used from a flux pen or  dispensed from a small bottle with a syringe-like needle.<br>        
    Wire brush, wire wool and  emery cloth are commonly used to prepare plumbing joints for connection.  Electronic joints are usually made between surfaces that have been tinned and  rarely require mechanical cleaning, though tarnished component leads and copper  traces with a dark layer of oxide passivation (due to aging), as on a new  prototyping board that has been on the shelf for about a year or more, may need  to be mechanically cleaned.<br>
    Some  fluxes for electronics are designed to be stable and inactive when cool and do  not need to be cleaned off, though they still can be if desired, while other  fluxes are acidic and must be removed after soldering to prevent corrosion of  the circuits. For PCB assembly and rework, either an alcohol or acetone is  commonly used with cotton swabs or bristle brushes to remove flux residue after  soldering. A heavy rag is usually used to remove flux from a plumbing joint  before it cools and hardens. A fiberglass brush can also be used.<br>
    A heat sink, such as  a crocodile clip, can be used to prevent damaging heat-sensitive components  while hand-soldering. The heat sink limits the temperature of the component  body by absorbing and dissipating heat (reducing the thermal resistance between  the component and the air), while the thermal resistance of the leads maintains  the temperature difference between the part of the leads being soldered and the  component body so that the leads become hot enough to melt the solder while the  component body remains cooler.</p>
